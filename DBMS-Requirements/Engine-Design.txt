					value
Entity Set = [Entity, Entity].attribute



				value (all things in relationship)
Entity Set <- Relationship -> Entity Set


Relationship 1:1, 1:many, many:many
(Arrows show :1 relationship)


Relationship.attribute

Subclass = ...


Key = Attribute Set for entity, s.t. no two 
entities have same values for all attr
- Must have key for every Entity Set
- can be called unique entity set

Do not use entity set if attribute will suffice

Do not overuse weak entity sets

Use unique key for each entity set UIN, SSN, VIN 
- try to use unique key


Relational Data Stored in Tables
Attribute + tuples

Sponsor
-----------------
senator | Bill		<- Attribute
----------------
smith	Tax
jones	defense		<- Tuple
smith	defense		<- Tuple


Relation Schema::
relation name + list of attributes
Database:: collection of relations
Database Schema:: set of ALL relation schemas in database


Entity Set -> Relation: Entity relation become Relational Attributes

Relationship -> relation: keys of connected ER entity sets become relational attributes


Entity Relation ENTITY SETS: a.k.a relations
Senator(name, part state); Bill(Name, address)

Entity Relation RELATIONSHIPS:
Senator(name, party) <- Contributed -> Lobbyiest(Organization, Name)
therefore...
Contributed(Senator, Lobbyist)	<- Relations

Relations can be combined

Do NOT combine many:many relations (causes redundancy)

Combine Relations:
	Many:1
	Person(name, birthdate, weight, height)
	NowLocatedIn(person, town)

Do not combine:
	Many:many
	Senator(name, party, state)
	Sponsored(senator, Bill)
	senator(name, party, state, years, bill)

Subclasses Options:

	Object Oriented Style:
		One relation for each subset, including all inherited attr

		official
		----------------
		Name 	| 	party
		-----------------
		x			y
		z			k

		representetive
		------------------------
		Name 	| 	party 	| district
		-------------------------
		x			y 			17
		z			K 			19

	Entity Relationship Style
		one realtion for each subclass (incld key)

			official
		----------------
		Name 	| 	party
		-----------------
		x			y
		z			k

		representetive
		--------------------
		Name	| district
		--------------------
		x			17
		z			19

	Null Style:
		One relation total, nulls for unknown
		------------------------
		Name 	| 	party 	| district
		-------------------------
		x			y 			17
		z			K 			19
		L 			p 			Null 

Key:	functionally determines all other attributes of the relation
	- given a relation and a key, there is only one tuple that orresponds to it
